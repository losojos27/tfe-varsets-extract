## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the following:

- Python 3.x installed
- TFE API token
- TFE organization and workspace details

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

    ``` shell
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/tfe-variable-sets-python.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   - requests
   - os
   - json
   - copy
   - argparse


## Usage

1. set ENV variables:

    ``` shell
    export TFE_ORG=<your TFE org>
    export TFE_URL=<your TFE URL>
    export TFE_USER_TOKEN=<your TFE Token>
    ```

2. Run the script:

    ``` shell
    python3 tfe-var-sets.py
    ```

## Features

- given a TFE organization, copies all variables from variable sets to their currrently assigned workspaces
- skips variables already assigned as workspace variables 
- accounts for variable sets assigned to:
  - workspaces
  - projects

## Limitations

- for variables marked as sensitive:
  - the workspace variable is created but not defined
  - you must define all sensitive variables before deleting the variable sets to maintain workflow
